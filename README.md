# SimpleArmory-ToyBox

Keep track of you World of Warcraft toy collection
http://simplearmory.com/ is a great site for tracking progress with achievements and collections in World of Warcraft but as the wow api doesn't track toys 

This extension adds toy page and allows you to manually check off the toys you have collected and show ones you still need.
