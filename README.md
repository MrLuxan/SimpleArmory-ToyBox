# SimpleArmory-ToyBox

(This extension no longer being updated as simplearmory now offers a self built toy tracking system)

http://simplearmory.com/ is a great site for tracking progress with achievements and collections in World of Warcraft but as the wow api doesn't track toys they aren't logged on the site. This extension adds toy page and allows you to manually check off the toys you have collected and show ones you still need.
